The primary services that this system adds on top of the mod's network system are modified approaches to DHCP, RARP, and DNS, along with a physical star-topology internetworking backbone.

SaberNet is a system that allows local networks to communicate with one another via a centralized routing center.
This routing center is its own local network, and is connected to local network clients via a Linked Card.
This Linked Card will be the ONLY connection between a local network and the routing center.

This system uses a simplified IP-style addressing scheme with a 16-bit network address and 16-bit host address.
The network address is used by the routing center to send packets to client networks.
The host address is used by the local network to send the packet to the appropriate machine.

A local network will have one SaberNet Router.
This router will provide DHCP- & RARP-style services to provide SaberNet addresses to local machines, and to map SNP addresses to physical addresses of machines on the same network.
The router will also serve as an actual router, providing the connection to the SaberNet routing center.
Local machines must have the sabernet API installed on them to use the SaberNet service.
This API provides the protocols to communicate through SaberNet, and will run as its own process in order to perform maintenance.
The maintenance that this API performs involves DHCP requests on machine boot, DNS & RARP caching, fragmentation and defragmentation of packets, and processing of incoming packets.
